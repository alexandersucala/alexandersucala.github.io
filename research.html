    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
        <p>
          A governance framework that restricts “authoritative decisions” in AI systems to externally validated artifacts
          (files, hashes, signed outputs, explicit state), preventing conversational or model-internal text from being
          treated as execution authority.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
        <p>
          A system that governs AI-assisted invention/research against a canonical, hash-verified corpus of prior work,
          enforcing novelty checks, authority boundaries, and deterministic reasoning protocols to reduce hallucinated
          overlap and corpus drift.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
        <p>
          A deterministic “intent-to-prompt” translation/compilation layer that converts user intent into
          constraint-compliant, optimized LLM prompts using non-model-driven rules, ensuring repeatable outputs and
          preventing hidden prompt drift.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
        <p>
          An execution architecture where runs are invalid unless correctness is established via mandatory preflight,
          runtime interface enforcement, deterministic seed authority, and artifact-first output reservation for
          auditable traceability.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
        <p>
          A control system that prevents runaway loops and ambiguous continuation in AI workflows by forcing explicit,
          validated state transitions and fail-closed behavior whenever preconditions, artifacts, or authority checks
          are not satisfied.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
        <p>
          A file-backed memory system that persists time-ordered state/decisions as authoritative artifacts, enabling
          deterministic recall, auditability, and consistent agent behavior across sessions without relying on chat-only
          context.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
        <p>
          An enforcement system that binds execution to explicit “intent contracts” (allowed actions, invariants, outputs)
          and blocks progression if contract constraints are violated, enabling safe, auditable automation without
          ambiguous authority.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
        <p>
          A pipeline design where “null” outcomes remain valid and interpretable results, separating infrastructure validity
          from domain outcome and preventing systems from forcing narrative success when reality yields no effect.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
        <p>
          A security/control architecture where sensitive actions require explicit speaker-authorization (voice identity or
          equivalent authority proof), preventing unauthorized execution and ensuring high-risk commands have strong,
          externally verifiable provenance.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
        <p>
          An orchestration system that locks execution to explicit state snapshots and artifact-validated transitions,
          preventing hidden state drift and ensuring every continuation step is justified by auditable, deterministic
          state changes.
        </p>
      </li>

          modulation, or actuation, defining how gradient sequences are generated, applied, and constrained for stable
          observable effects.
        </p>
      </li>

       <li>
        <strong>Inertial Mass Modulation Device</strong>
        <p>
          A conceptual device architecture focused on modulating inertial response through structured field/geometry
          interaction, defining how modulation is produced, constrained, and measured without conflating execution validity
          with physical outcome.
        </p>
      </li>

       <li>
        <strong>Field Resynchronization Computational Substrate (FRCS)</strong>
        <p>
          A computational substrate that re-synchronizes evolving system state under drift by enforcing consistent update
          ordering, phase/step alignment, and artifact-tracked checkpoints, enabling reproducible long-horizon runs and
