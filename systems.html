    <h1>Systems</h1>

    <p>
      Alexander builds execution governed systems for exploratory computation and AI workflows.
      The focus is reliability under iteration with determinism auditability and fail closed control.
    </p>

    <h2>AUFG Research System</h2>
    <p>
      AUFG Alexandrian Unified Field Geometry is operated as a lab grade computational program.
      Every experiment is state locked reproducible and falsification first.
      Runs produce structured artifacts including metadata logs failures and summaries under deterministic authority rules,
      allowing results to be replayed exactly and compared across revisions.
      The goal is stable measurement so that when something changes the system proves why.
    </p>

    <h2>Fail Closed Execution Governance</h2>
    <p>
      A run is treated as invalid unless correctness is explicitly established.
      Preflight validation and runtime enforcement convert silent failure modes into explicit invalid runs,
      preventing successful but incorrect outputs from contaminating results.
    </p>

    <h2>Artifact First Authority</h2>
    <p>
      Execution produces authoritative artifacts for every attempt whether successful or not.
      Metadata failure logs and run directories are created or reserved before computation begins,
      enabling traceability and post hoc auditing at scale.
    </p>

    <h2>Deterministic Seed and Interface Authority</h2>
    <p>
      Determinism is enforced as an execution invariant.
      Seeds are derived from canonical inputs rather than runtime randomness.
      Parameter transmission and callable interfaces are enforced at runtime to prevent silent drift.
    </p>

    <h2>Corpus Governed Novelty Checking</h2>
    <p>
      New ideas are evaluated against a canonical indexed corpus of prior patents and papers.
      The workflow is designed to reduce overlap risk and accelerate iteration through index scanning verdicts and design around paths.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploratory Research Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      Long horizon experimentation requires governance beyond unit tests and continuous integration.
      Alexander designs systems that preserve development velocity while maintaining reproducibility and interpretability across runs.
