      <h2>Patents (18) — Provisional Filings</h2>
      <hr>

      <h3>AI Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Governed Stateless Context Reconstruction for AI-Assisted Software System Modification</strong>
          <p>
            This patent is about making sure an AI actually understands the real situation before it changes software.
            It's about not relying on memory or conversation so mistakes don’t carry over.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
          <p>
            This idea makes sure an AI can’t treat its own words as permission to act. 
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            This system helps prevent AI from repeating old ideas or claiming something is new when it isn’t.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
          <p>
            This patent focuses on making AI instructions behave consistently.
            The same request should lead to the same result, instead of changing unpredictably.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            This system treats results as invalid unless everything checks out first.
            It stops early instead of producing misleading answers.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            This design prevents AI systems from running endlessly or repeating themselves
            without clear approval to continue.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            This system removes reliance on chat history and ensures results can be reviewed and trusted later.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
          <p>
            This ensures an AI only does what it was explicitly allowed to do.
            If it tries to go beyond that, the system stops it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
          <p>
            This design treats “nothing happened” as a valid beneficial outcome that contributes to system progression
            instead of forcing a success story when there isn’t one.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            This system acts as a 2 factor voice authentication system through AI to perform voice activated 
            sensitive actions, adding security and preventing misuse or unauthorized control in spoken AI integrated systems
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
          <p>
            This ensures AI systems only move forward when their current state is clearly defined and verified,
            preventing quiet changes from slipping in unnoticed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physics Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Materials & Manufacturing Framework</strong>
          <p>
            This patent focuses on how physical shapes and structures can be built consistently, so experiments don’t fail
            just because something was assembled slightly differently.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Oscillation Engine for Controlled Cyclic Modulation of Energy Representations</strong>
          <p>
            This idea explores how repeating patterns can be created and controlled in physical systems, without relying on
            unstable or unpredictable behavior.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Field Coupling Device for Controlled Interaction of Distinct Energy Geometries</strong>
          <p>
            This patent describes a way to carefully manage how different physical systems influence each other, instead of
            letting them interact randomly.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Triangular-Petalled Resonance Manifold System And Method</strong>
          <p>
            This work investigates how certain geometric shapes can support stable, repeatable resonance behavior that can
            be measured and studied.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Field Gradient Drive System</strong>
          <p>
            This system focuses on using changing patterns to guide motion or behavior in a controlled way, rather than
            relying on brute force.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Inertial Mass Modulation Device</strong>
          <p>
            This patent explores structured ways to study changes in inertial behavior while clearly separating experimental
            validity from physical outcomes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field Resynchronization Computational Substrate (FRCS)</strong>
          <p>
            This system keeps long-running computations from drifting over time by regularly bringing them back into
            alignment, so results stay interpretable.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
