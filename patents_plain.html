      <h3>AI Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Governed Stateless Context Reconstruction for AI-Assisted Software System Modification</strong>
          <p>
            This patent is about making sure an AI actually understands the real situation before it changes software.
            Instead of relying on memory or conversation, the system rebuilds the situation from verified information
            each time, so mistakes don’t quietly carry over.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
          <p>
            This idea makes sure an AI can’t treat its own words as permission to act. Important decisions are only allowed
            when they are backed by real, verified information outside the AI itself.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            This system helps prevent AI from repeating old ideas or claiming something is new when it isn’t.
            It does that by checking work against a trusted library of past research before moving forward.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
          <p>
            This patent focuses on making AI instructions behave consistently.
            The same request should lead to the same result, instead of changing unpredictably.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            This system treats results as invalid unless everything checks out first.
            If something is wrong, it stops early instead of producing misleading answers.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            This design prevents AI systems from running endlessly or repeating themselves
            without clear approval to continue.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            Instead of relying on chat history, this system stores important decisions in real records
            that can be reviewed and trusted later.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
          <p>
            This ensures an AI only does what it was explicitly allowed to do.
            If it tries to go beyond that, the system stops it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
          <p>
            This design treats “nothing happened” as a valid outcome,
            instead of forcing a success story when there isn’t one.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            This system requires clear proof of who gave a command before allowing sensitive actions,
            helping prevent misuse or unauthorized control.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
          <p>
            This ensures AI systems only move forward when their current state is clearly defined and verified,
            preventing quiet changes from slipping in unnoticed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physics Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Materials & Manufacturing Framework</strong>
          <p>
            This patent focuses on how physical shapes and structures can be built consistently, so experiments don’t fail
            just because something was assembled slightly differently.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Oscillation Engine for Controlled Cyclic Modulation of Energy Representations</strong>
          <p>
            This idea explores how repeating patterns can be created and controlled in physical systems, without relying on
            unstable or unpredictable behavior.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Field Coupling Device for Controlled Interaction of Distinct Energy Geometries</strong>
          <p>
            This patent describes a way to carefully manage how different physical systems influence each other, instead of
            letting them interact randomly.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Triangular-Petalled Resonance Manifold System And Method</strong>
          <p>
            This work investigates how certain geometric shapes can support stable, repeatable resonance behavior that can
            be measured and studied.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Field Gradient Drive System</strong>
          <p>
            This system focuses on using changing patterns to guide motion or behavior in a controlled way, rather than
            relying on brute force.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Inertial Mass Modulation Device</strong>
          <p>
            This patent explores structured ways to study changes in inertial behavior while clearly separating experimental
            validity from physical outcomes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field Resynchronization Computational Substrate (FRCS)</strong>
          <p>
            This system keeps long-running computations from drifting over time by regularly bringing them back into
            alignment, so results stay interpretable.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
