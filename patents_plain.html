      <h2>Patents (20) — Provisional Filings</h2>
      <hr>

      <h3>System Patent</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Execution and Authority-Conditioned Validity for Artificial Intelligence Systems</strong>
          <p>
            Stops systems from finishing their work if something important is missing, so bad or unsafe results 
            never get created in the first place.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>AI Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Execution and Authority-Conditioned Validity for Artificial Intelligence Systems</strong>
          <p>
            Makes sure an AI isn’t allowed to give an answer or take action unless it’s actually permitted and properly 
            informed to do so.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Governed Stateless Context Reconstruction for AI-Assisted Software System Modification</strong>
          <p>
            Makes sure an AI uses the real, verified project situation each time before changing software, so old mistakes
            don’t quietly carry forward.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
          <p>
            Prevents an AI from treating its own words as permission to act. “Go” decisions must be backed by verified information.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            Helps prevent fake originality by checking new work against a trusted library of past work before moving forward.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
          <p>
            Makes AI instructions more consistent, so the same request produces the same kind of result instead of drifting.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            Treats results as invalid unless required checks pass first. If something is off, it stops instead of guessing.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            Prevents endless looping or repeated actions without clear permission to continue.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            Stores key decisions as real records, not just chat text, so they can be reviewed later and trusted.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
          <p>
            Ensures an AI only does what it was explicitly allowed to do. If it tries to go beyond that, it gets blocked.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
          <p>
            Treats “nothing happened” as a valid outcome, so systems don’t invent a success story when reality says otherwise.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            Adds identity-based approval for sensitive voice commands, helping prevent unauthorized or accidental actions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
          <p>
            Forces AI systems to move forward only when the current state is clearly defined and verified, so silent drift can’t sneak in.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physics Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Materials & Manufacturing Framework</strong>
          <p>
            Focuses on building physical geometries consistently, so experiments don’t fail just because parts were made differently.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Oscillation Engine for Controlled Cyclic Modulation of Energy Representations</strong>
          <p>
            Explores controlled repeating patterns in physical systems, designed to be stable and repeatable.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Field Coupling Device for Controlled Interaction of Distinct Energy Geometries</strong>
          <p>
            Describes controlled ways for different physical systems to influence each other, instead of interacting unpredictably.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Triangular-Petalled Resonance Manifold System And Method</strong>
          <p>
            Investigates how certain shapes can support stable resonance behavior that can be measured and studied.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Field Gradient Drive System</strong>
          <p>
            Focuses on using changing patterns to guide behavior in a controlled way, rather than relying on brute force.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Inertial Mass Modulation Device</strong>
          <p>
            Explores structured ways to study changes in inertial behavior while keeping “good experiment” separate from “big claim.”
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field Resynchronization Computational Substrate (FRCS)</strong>
          <p>
            Keeps long-running computations from drifting over time by bringing them back into alignment so results stay interpretable.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
