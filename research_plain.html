      <h3>AI Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Governed Stateless Context Reconstruction for AI-Assisted Software System Modification</strong>
          <p>
            Think “no more relying on chat memory.” The system rebuilds the exact context an AI needs from real files and
            verified metadata (like hashes), then forces the AI to follow explicit rules. If anything doesn’t match, it
            stops instead of producing risky edits.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
          <p>
            Only verified external evidence counts as “authority” (files, hashes, signed outputs, explicit state). The AI
            can suggest ideas, but it can’t treat its own text as permission to do something important.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            A system that forces AI-assisted research to constantly check against a verified library of your prior work, so
            it doesn’t “reinvent” your own ideas, hallucinate novelty, or drift over time.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
          <p>
            A consistent “compiler layer” that converts intent into stable prompts using rules (not vibes). The goal is
            repeatable outputs and fewer hidden prompt changes that silently alter results.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            A run is considered invalid unless it passes checks first. The system verifies setup, enforces interfaces while
            running, locks randomness/inputs, and produces a clean audit trail you can replay later.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
          <p>
            Prevents runaway “agent loops.” The workflow can only continue through explicit, validated state transitions. If
            a required condition isn’t met, it stops.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            Memory is stored as time-ordered files you can inspect, version, and audit. That makes recall consistent across
            sessions without relying on chat history.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
          <p>
            Every run has an explicit “contract” (allowed actions, invariants, required outputs). If the system violates the
            contract, it blocks execution instead of letting it slide.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
          <p>
            Treats “nothing happened” as a valid result. It separates “the experiment ran correctly” from “we got the effect
            we hoped for,” so the pipeline doesn’t force success narratives.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
          <p>
            Sensitive actions require an external proof of authorization (like voice identity). This prevents unauthorized
            execution and strengthens provenance for high-risk commands.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
          <p>
            Locks execution to explicit state snapshots and only allows progress when state changes are justified and
            verified. This prevents “invisible drift” across steps.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Physics Patents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Materials & Manufacturing Framework</strong>
          <p>
            A practical framework for building physical structures where geometry matters. It focuses on how to design and
            manufacture shapes consistently, so the intended behaviors don’t vanish due to sloppy fabrication.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field-Geometry Oscillation Engine for Controlled Cyclic Modulation of Energy Representations</strong>
          <p>
            A way to generate controlled oscillations by shaping geometry and timing. The goal is stable, tunable patterns
            that can route energy into specific response bands.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Field Coupling Device for Controlled Interaction of Distinct Energy Geometries</strong>
          <p>
            A class of devices meant to “couple” different field/geometry patterns so they can influence each other in a
            controlled way, instead of interacting chaotically.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Triangular-Petalled Resonance Manifold System And Method</strong>
          <p>
            A resonance system built around a triangular-petalled geometry. It defines structural constraints and methods
            for producing stable, measurable resonance signatures.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Field Gradient Drive System</strong>
          <p>
            A drive/control approach that uses changing gradient patterns to excite or modulate a system. It specifies how
            to generate and apply those patterns safely and consistently.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Inertial Mass Modulation Device</strong>
          <p>
            A conceptual device architecture aimed at changing inertial response via structured field/geometry interaction,
            with emphasis on how to measure effects without confusing “the run was valid” with “the physics worked.”
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Field Resynchronization Computational Substrate (FRCS)</strong>
          <p>
            A compute substrate that fights drift by enforcing consistent update ordering, step alignment, and checkpointing
            as verifiable artifacts—so long runs stay interpretable.
          </p>
        </li>
