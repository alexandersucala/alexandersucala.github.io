  <h3>System Patent</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Systems for Validity-by-Construction of Computational Artifacts</strong>
      <p>
        System architectures that prevent execution from completing unless required structural conditions are satisfied,
        ensuring results are trustworthy by construction rather than validated after the fact.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>AI Patents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Multi-Stage Language Model Pipeline for Policy-Compliant Content Generation</strong>
      <p>
        A multi-stage LLM execution pipeline where compliance constraints are progressively introduced across distinct stages 
        maintaining end-to-end compliance guarantees
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Fail-Closed Execution and Authority-Conditioned Validity for Artificial Intelligence Systems</strong>
      <p>
        AI execution frameworks that condition output generation on verified authority and context, preventing hallucinated
        or unauthorized results from being produced.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Artifact-Governed Stateless Context Reconstruction for AI-Assisted Software System Modification</strong>
      <p>
        Systems for ensuring an AI works from verified, current project context each time, rather than relying on chat memory
        or assumptions.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
      <p>
        Frameworks that restrict “permission to act” to externally verifiable artifacts instead of model-generated text.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
      <p>
        Governance systems that check work against a canonical corpus to reduce false novelty claims and prevent drift.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
      <p>
        Methods for translating intent into repeatable, constraint-compliant prompts with reduced variability.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
      <p>
        Execution architectures where outputs are treated as invalid unless required validation gates succeed.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
      <p>
        Control systems that prevent ambiguous continuation and runaway looping without explicit validated state.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
      <p>
        File-backed state and recall mechanisms for auditability and repeatable behavior across sessions.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
      <p>
        Systems that bind execution to explicit intent contracts and stop when constraints are violated.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
      <p>
        Pipeline designs that treat null outcomes as valid results rather than forcing a narrative of success.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
      <p>
        Authorization schemes where sensitive actions require explicit verified speaker approval (or equivalent proof).
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
      <p>
        Orchestration systems that lock progression to verified state snapshots and artifact-validated transitions.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
