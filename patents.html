  <h3>AI Patents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Artifact-Governed Stateless Context Reconstruction for AI-Assisted Software System Modification</strong>
      <p>
        A system and method for deterministic reconstruction of authoritative software system context for AI-assisted
        modification workflows. The invention externalizes authority from AI conversational memory by generating
        artifact-governed context packs containing verified files, metadata, integrity hashes, and explicit behavioral
        constraints. The approach enables stateless, fail-closed, reproducible AI collaboration across sessions without
        reliance on persistent AI memory or agent state.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Artifact-Only Authority Framework for Artificial Intelligence Decision Systems</strong>
      <p>
        A governance framework that restricts “authoritative decisions” in AI systems to externally validated artifacts
        (files, hashes, signed outputs, explicit state), preventing conversational or model-internal text from being
        treated as execution authority.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Canonical Corpus-Based Governance System for Enforcing Novelty, Authority, and Deterministic Reasoning in AI-Assisted Invention and Research Workflows</strong>
      <p>
        A system that governs AI-assisted invention/research against a canonical, hash-verified corpus of prior work,
        enforcing novelty checks, authority boundaries, and deterministic reasoning protocols to reduce hallucinated
        overlap and corpus drift.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Deterministic Prompt Translation and Compilation System for Large Language Models</strong>
      <p>
        A deterministic “intent-to-prompt” translation/compilation layer that converts user intent into
        constraint-compliant, optimized LLM prompts using non-model-driven rules, ensuring repeatable outputs and
        preventing hidden prompt drift.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Fail-Closed Execution Governance System for Deterministic and Auditable Exploratory Computational Workflows</strong>
      <p>
        An execution architecture where runs are invalid unless correctness is established via mandatory preflight,
        runtime interface enforcement, deterministic seed authority, and artifact-first output reservation for
        auditable traceability.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Fail-Closed Zero-Loop Control System for Artificial Intelligence Workflows</strong>
      <p>
        A control system that prevents runaway loops and ambiguous continuation in AI workflows by forcing explicit,
        validated state transitions and fail-closed behavior whenever preconditions, artifacts, or authority checks
        are not satisfied.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>File-Backed Temporal Memory and Deterministic Recall System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
      <p>
        A file-backed memory system that persists time-ordered state/decisions as authoritative artifacts, enabling
        deterministic recall, auditability, and consistent agent behavior across sessions without relying on chat-only
        context.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Intent-Contract Enforcement System for Artificial Intelligence Execution</strong>
      <p>
        An enforcement system that binds execution to explicit “intent contracts” (allowed actions, invariants, outputs)
        and blocks progression if contract constraints are violated, enabling safe, auditable automation without
        ambiguous authority.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Null-Result-Valid Artificial Intelligence Research and Decision Pipelines</strong>
      <p>
        A pipeline design where “null” outcomes remain valid and interpretable results, separating infrastructure validity
        from domain outcome and preventing systems from forcing narrative success when reality yields no effect.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Speaker-Authorized Security and Control System for Artificial Intelligence Agents</strong>
      <p>
        A security/control architecture where sensitive actions require explicit speaker-authorization (voice identity or
        equivalent authority proof), preventing unauthorized execution and ensuring high-risk commands have strong,
        externally verifiable provenance.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>State-Locked Artificial Intelligence Orchestration System with Artifact-Based Authority Control</strong>
      <p>
        An orchestration system that locks execution to explicit state snapshots and artifact-validated transitions,
        preventing hidden state drift and ensuring every continuation step is justified by auditable, deterministic
        state changes.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Physics Patents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Field-Geometry Materials & Manufacturing Framework</strong>
      <p>
        A framework for designing and fabricating physical structures/material systems intended to implement field- or
        geometry-driven behaviors, including constraints on geometry, assembly, and repeatable manufacturing to
        preserve intended interaction patterns.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Field-Geometry Oscillation Engine for Controlled Cyclic Modulation of Energy Representations</strong>
      <p>
        An engine for producing controlled oscillatory behavior by cyclically modulating geometry/field representations,
        defining how oscillation patterns are generated, stabilized, and tuned to route energy into targeted response
        bands.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Geometric Field Coupling Device for Controlled Interaction of Distinct Energy Geometries</strong>
      <p>
        A device class for coupling and translating between distinct energy-field “geometries” through structured spatial
        configuration, enabling controlled interaction and modulation across otherwise separate physical domains.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Triangular-Petalled Resonance Manifold System And Method</strong>
      <p>
        A resonance/manifold system based on triangular-petalled geometry intended to generate weighted geometric field
        interactions, defining structural constraints and methods for producing stable, measurable resonance signatures.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Dynamic Field Gradient Drive System</strong>
      <p>
        A drive/control architecture that uses dynamic field-gradient patterns as a governing mechanism for excitation,
        modulation, or actuation, defining how gradient sequences are generated, applied, and constrained for stable
        observable effects.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Inertial Mass Modulation Device</strong>
      <p>
        A conceptual device architecture focused on modulating inertial response through structured field/geometry
        interaction, defining how modulation is produced, constrained, and measured without conflating execution validity
        with physical outcome.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Field Resynchronization Computational Substrate (FRCS)</strong>
      <p>
        A computational substrate that re-synchronizes evolving system state under drift by enforcing consistent update
        ordering, phase/step alignment, and artifact-tracked checkpoints, enabling reproducible long-horizon runs and
        stable interpretation.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
