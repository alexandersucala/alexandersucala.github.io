      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Alexander designs and builds production AI systems where failure means silence, not
        hallucination. His architectural approach treats large language models as probabilistic
        components embedded within deterministic control structures, never as autonomous
        decision-makers. Every system he ships enforces fail-closed execution, hallucination
        verification against ground truth, and confidence provenance classification that
        distinguishes document-backed findings from model opinion.
      </p>

      <p>
        His patent portfolio spans fail-closed execution gates, deterministic-first AI triggering,
        constrained self-correction schemas, bidirectional decision quality analysis, four-quadrant
        diagnostic regime detection, hallucination verification, confidence provenance classification,
        artifact-based authority, zero-loop control, and corpus-governed novelty checking. These are
        not theoretical frameworks. Each one is implemented in at least one
        <a href="tools.html">production system</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He also leads the Alexandrian Unified Field Geometry (AUFG) program, an independent,
        falsification-first research effort in geometry-driven field computation with its own
        patent and publication track.

      <p>
        <a href="tools.html#codereview">CodeReview AI</a> performs document-grounded compliance
        reviews on GitHub pull requests with a two-pass hallucination guard and traffic-light output.
        <a href="tools.html#finance">Finance Assistant</a> runs a three-stage LLM pipeline with
        dual compliance gates for stock analysis.
        <a href="tools.html#tradeengine">TradeEngine</a> is an autonomous crypto trading agent
        with deterministic-first triggering, five circuit breakers, and bidirectional learning
        from both executed and rejected trades.
