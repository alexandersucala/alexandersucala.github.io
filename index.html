      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Alexander Sucala is an independent researcher and systems engineer working on deterministic AI governance
        architectures and geometry-driven field computation. He designs artifact-based control frameworks for large
        language model (LLM) systems and leads the Alexandrian Unified Field Geometry (AUFG) program—an independent,
        falsification-first effort in geometry-driven field computation.
      </p>

      <p>
        His AI work centers on externalized authority, reproducibility, failure-mode isolation, and auditability in
        autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. He approaches LLMs as probabilistic components embedded within deterministic
        control structures—not as decision-making agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        He runs lab-grade, falsification-first research with strict experimental locking, constraint ledgers, and
        reproducible pipelines. He has authored multiple research <a href="research.html">papers</a> and filed multiple
        provisional <a href="research.html">patent</a> applications spanning AI governance, exploratory computational systems,
        and geometric coupling architectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Background: He grew up in the Bay Area and studied computer science, engineering, and business administration.

      <h2>What he builds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fail-closed execution and deterministic orchestration for AI-assisted workflows</li>
        <li>Artifact-based governance: validation, audit trails, and authority separation</li>
        <li>Reproducible research pipelines for exploratory computational systems</li>
        <li>AUFG: geometry-driven field models and computational experiments</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        He designs systems that fail closed, replay exactly, and stay auditable under stress.

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        For fun he rides motorcycles, hikes, travels, reads, and keeps building—AI systems, research tooling, and experiments.
