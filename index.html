      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Alexander Sucala is an independent researcher and systems engineer working on deterministic AI governance
        architectures and geometry-driven field computation. He designs artifact-based control frameworks for large
        language model (LLM) systems and leads the Alexandrian Unified Field Geometry (AUFG) program—an independent,
        falsification-first effort in geometry-driven field computation.
      </p>

      <p>
        His AI work centers on externalized authority, reproducibility, failure-mode isolation, and auditability in
        autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. He approaches LLMs as probabilistic components embedded within deterministic
        control structures—not as decision-making agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        He runs lab-grade, falsification-first research with strict experimental locking, constraint ledgers, and
        reproducible pipelines. He has authored multiple research <a href="research.html">papers</a> and filed multiple
        provisional <a href="research.html#patents">patent</a> applications spanning AI governance, exploratory computational systems,
        and geometric coupling architectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Background: He grew up in the Silicon Valley and studied computer science, engineering, communications,
        and business administration at De Anza Community College. He has always been fascinated by science, tech, and business.

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        For fun he rides motorcycles, hikes, travels, reads, and keeps building—AI systems, research tooling, and experiments.
