      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I’m Alexander Sucala, an independent researcher and systems engineer working on deterministic AI governance
        architectures and geometry-driven field computation. I design artifact-based control frameworks for large
        language model (LLM) systems and lead the Alexandrian Unified Field Geometry (AUFG) program—an independent,
        falsification-first effort in geometry-driven field computation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My AI work centers on externalized authority, reproducibility, failure-mode isolation, and auditability in
        autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. I treat LLMs as probabilistic components embedded within deterministic
        control structures—not as decision-making agents.
      </p>

      <p>
        I run lab-grade, falsification-first research with strict experimental locking, constraint ledgers, and
        reproducible pipelines. I’ve authored multiple research papers and filed multiple provisional patent
        applications spanning AI governance, exploratory computational systems, and geometric coupling architectures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Background: I grew up in the Bay Area and studied computer science, engineering, and business administration.

      <h2>What I build</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fail-closed execution and deterministic orchestration for AI-assisted workflows</li>
        <li>Artifact-based governance: validation, audit trails, and authority separation</li>
        <li>Reproducible research pipelines for exploratory computational systems</li>
        <li>AUFG: geometry-driven field models and computational experiments</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        I design systems that fail closed, replay exactly, and stay auditable under stress.

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        For fun I ride motorcycles, hike, travel, read, and keep building—AI systems, research tooling, and experiments.
