        Alexander builds AI systems that either prove their answers are correct or refuse
        to answer. 30+ patent filings. 14+ published papers. 4 production systems running right now.

      <h2>What Alexander does</h2>

      <p>
        Most AI systems have a dangerous habit: when they don't have enough information to answer
        correctly, they guess and present the guess as if it were fact. The output looks confident.
        It might be completely wrong. And you can't tell the difference until real damage is done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexander builds systems that make this impossible. If the AI can't prove its answer from
        real data, the answer doesn't ship. If the math says one thing and the AI says another,
        the math wins. Every finding is labeled with where it came from so you can tell the
        difference between something backed by your actual documentation and something the AI
        thinks is a good idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        These aren't research prototypes. There are four systems running in production right now,
        each one implementing the same patented architectural patterns across different domains:
        <a href="tools_plain.html#codereview">automated code review</a>,
        <a href="tools_plain.html#finance">financial analysis</a>,
        <a href="tools_plain.html#tradeengine">autonomous trading</a>, and
        <a href="tools_plain.html#briefing">daily intelligence briefings</a>.
        The <a href="systems_plain.html">Systems</a> page explains how they work.
        The <a href="patents_plain.html">Patents</a> and <a href="research_plain.html">Papers</a>
        pages document the ideas behind them.
