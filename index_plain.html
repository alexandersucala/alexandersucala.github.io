      <h2>What Alexander does</h2>

      <p>
        A lot of computer and AI work breaks in quiet ways. Everything looks like it worked, but later it becomes clear the answer
        was wrong. Not because anyone made a mistake on purpose, but because something small changed, like the wrong file being used,
        a setting being different, or the computer guessing differently this time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexander’s work is to stop that from happening. He builds systems that check everything before starting, watch what is
        happening while it runs, and keep a clear record of what was done. If something is not right, the system stops instead of
        producing a bad answer.
      </p>

    <section class="highlights" aria-label="Highlights">
      <h2>What that means in real life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The computer stops instead of pretending it worked</li>
        <li>The same process can be run again and produce the same result</li>
        <li>It is always clear what was done and how it was done</li>
        <li>Mistakes are caught early instead of months later</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        In short fewer surprises less wasted time and results that can actually be trusted.

      <p>
        Outside of work Alexander rides motorcycles hikes travels reads and keeps building systems tools and experiments.
