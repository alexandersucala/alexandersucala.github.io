      <h2>What I do</h2>

      <p>
       A lot of computer and AI work breaks in quiet ways. Everything looks like it worked, but later you find out the answer
       was wrong. Not because anyone messed up on purpose — but because something small changed, like the wrong file was used,
       a setting was different, or the computer guessed differently this time.
      </p>

      <p>
       My job is to stop that from happening. I build systems that double-check everything before starting, watch what’s
       happening while it runs, and keep a clear record of what was done. If something isn’t right, the system stops instead of
       giving a bad answer.
      </p>

     <h2>What that means in real life</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>The computer stops instead of pretending it worked</li>
      <li>You can run the same thing again and get the same result</li>
      <li>You can see exactly what was done and how it was done</li>
      <li>Mistakes get caught early instead of months later</li>
     </ul>
     <p class="note">
       In short: fewer surprises, less wasted time, and results you can actually trust.

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        For fun I ride motorcycles, hike, travel, read, and keep building—systems, tools, and experiments.
