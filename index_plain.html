      <h2>What Alexander does</h2>

      <p>
       A lot of AI systems fail in a subtle way. The software runs correctly and nothing crashes, but the answer itself is unreliable.
      Large language models are designed to produce the most statistically likely response from limited information.
      When required context or authoritative information is missing, the model fills the gaps with plausible guesses.
      The result looks confident and complete, but may be wrong in ways that are difficult to notice later.
     </p>

     <p>
      Alexander’s work is to stop that from happening. He builds systems that safeguard inputs context and prior work so the AI
      cannot silently guess its way through missing information. If required information is not present or cannot be verified,
      the system stops instead of producing a convincing but untrustworthy answer.
    </p>

    <section class="highlights" aria-label="Highlights">
      <h2>What that means in real life</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>The system refuses to answer when required information is missing</li>
       <li>AI outputs are based only on verified and allowed context</li>
       <li>It is always clear what information the AI was allowed to use</li>
       <li>Confident but unsupported guesses are blocked before they appear</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
       In short fewer false confidence failures less rework and results that can actually be trusted.

        Outside of work Alexander rides motorcycles hikes travels reads and keeps building systems tools and experiments.
