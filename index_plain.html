      I build reliable systems that keep complex software and AI experiments from quietly breaking.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of modern research and AI work fails in sneaky ways: the code runs, but the result is wrong because something
      drifted—an input changed, a function signature changed, a file didn’t get saved, or randomness behaved differently.
      Over time, this can waste weeks and corrupt conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work is about preventing that. I build “fail-closed” execution systems that check the setup before a run,
      enforce what’s allowed while it runs, and always produce an auditable record of what happened. If something is off,
      the system stops early instead of producing misleading output.
