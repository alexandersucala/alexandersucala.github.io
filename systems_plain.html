        Alexander builds systems that keep research and AI programs reliable while improvement happens quickly so results are not trusted
        just because they look confident.

    <section class="about" aria-label="Overview">
      <h2>What these systems are for</h2>

      <p>
        A lot of AI systems fail in a subtle way. The software runs correctly and nothing crashes, but the answer itself is unreliable.
        Large language models are designed to produce the most statistically likely response from limited information.
        When required context or authoritative information is missing, the model fills the gaps with plausible guesses.
        The result looks confident and complete, but may be wrong in ways that are difficult to notice later.
      </p>

      <p>
        These systems are designed to make that almost impossible.
        Inputs context and prior work are safeguarded so the AI only uses verified and allowed information.
        If required information is missing or cannot be verified, the system stops instead of producing a convincing but untrustworthy answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short Alexander designs AI systems that either produce answers backed by known information or refuse to answer until the correct
        information is present.

      <h2>Core systems</h2>

      <h3>AUFG research system</h3>
      <p>
        AUFG runs like a lab program.
        Each experiment creates its own historical record with locked inputs and repeatable conditions,
        making results easy to reproduce and compare across changes.
        The goal is not impressive charts but trustworthy measurement.
      </p>

      <h3>Fail closed execution</h3>
      <p>
        If required information is missing or a validation check fails the run is marked invalid and stops early.
        This prevents outputs that look finished but are actually based on incomplete context or unsupported assumptions.
      </p>

      <h3>Artifact first records</h3>
      <p>
        Every attempt leaves behind a clear record.
        Even failed runs produce useful evidence including metadata logs and failure traces,
        making debugging faster and decisions easier to defend later.
      </p>

      <h3>Deterministic inputs and enforced interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Randomness is controlled instead of left to chance.
        Inputs interfaces and parameters are enforced so small silent changes do not slip in unnoticed
        and so repeated runs use the same authoritative context.
      </p>

      <h3>Novelty checking against prior work</h3>
      <p>
        New ideas are checked against a trusted library of prior papers and patents.
        This helps catch overlap early and speeds up iteration through a simple flow of checking deciding and adjusting.
      </p>

      <h3>Exploratory research infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Long term exploration needs more than basic testing.
        These systems protect context traceability and result integrity while still allowing work to move quickly.
