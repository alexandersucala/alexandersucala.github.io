        Four production systems built on the same principle: if the AI can't prove its answer
        is correct, the answer doesn't ship.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about" aria-label="Overview">
      <h2>The core problem</h2>

      <p>
        Most AI systems have a dangerous habit. When they don't have enough information to answer
        correctly, they don't tell you &mdash; they just fill in the blanks with something that sounds right.
        The output looks confident and complete, but it might be wrong in ways nobody notices until
        real damage is done. A wrong compliance finding. A bad trade. A hallucinated policy violation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alexander builds systems that make this structurally impossible. Every system on this page
        follows the same rule: if required information is missing, if a verification check fails, or
        if the AI contradicts the actual data, the system stops rather than producing an answer it
        can't back up. The same architectural patterns &mdash; covered by 30+ patent filings &mdash; run
        through code review, financial analysis, autonomous trading, and automated briefings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlights" aria-label="Systems">
      <h2>How these systems work</h2>

      <h3>Everything fails closed</h3>
      <p>
        "Fail closed" means the system treats silence as safer than a guess. If a code review
        can't find your policy document to back up a finding, the finding gets killed instead of
        posted. If a trading signal can't pass eight independent safety checks, no money moves.
        If a financial analysis can't verify its data sources, it tells you what it doesn't know
        instead of making something up. Every system is designed so that failure looks like
        "I don't have enough information" rather than "here's a confident wrong answer."
      </p>

      <h3>The AI doesn't get to make things up</h3>
      <p>
        Every system has a verification layer that checks the AI's work against real data before
        anything reaches you. In code review, a second AI model re-reads every finding against
        your actual documentation &mdash; if it can't prove the finding from what's written, the finding
        dies. In trading, the AI's stated numbers get compared against math that was computed
        independently &mdash; if they don't match, the trade is rejected. In financial analysis, every
        claim must trace back to a specific data source or it gets flagged as unverifiable.
      </p>

      <h3>You can tell where the answer came from</h3>
      <p>
        Normal AI confidence scores tell you how sure the model is. That's not very useful &mdash; AI
        models are confidently wrong all the time. These systems tell you <em>why</em> the model
        is confident. Every finding is labeled: either it came from your actual documentation
        (with a citation you can check), or it's the AI's own suggestion (clearly marked as such).
        The traffic-light system &mdash; red means stop, yellow means look, green means go &mdash; is built
        on top of these labeled findings, not on how sure the AI feels about itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Math first, AI second</h3>
      <p>
        In every system, the straightforward computational work happens first using regular
        deterministic code that can't hallucinate. The AI only gets involved when there's
        something that requires judgment or interpretation &mdash; and even then, it works from the
        math's output as its starting point, not from raw data. In the trading system, technical
        indicators are computed locally in microseconds. The AI only activates when the math says
        "something interesting is happening here, figure out what it means." This keeps the AI
        on a leash: it interprets verified facts rather than inventing its own.
      </p>

      <h3>The system can't teach itself bad habits</h3>
      <p>
        The trading system improves over time, but it does so under strict rules. Every lesson it
        learns has an expiration date, a minimum number of observations before it takes effect,
        and limits on how much it can change at once. It can't lock in a bad lesson permanently
        based on a small run of bad luck.
      </p>

      <h3>It learns from what it didn't do, not just what it did</h3>
      <p>
        Most systems only learn from their mistakes. This one learns from four things at once:
        trades that worked (keep doing this), trades that didn't work (stop doing this),
        trades it rejected that would have lost (good call, the safety checks are working), and
        trades it rejected that would have won (the safety checks might be too strict here).
        Every rejected trade is tracked with the same level of detail as an executed trade, so
        the system can compare what it did against what would have happened if it hadn't said no.
      </p>

      <h3>It knows where the problem is, not just that there is one</h3>
      <p>
        The four types of feedback feed into a diagnostic system that answers a specific question:
        if something is going wrong, is it because the signal selection is off, the safety gates
        are too tight, the execution timing is bad, or the whole market has changed? A system that
        knows it's losing money is basic. A system that can tell you <em>why</em> &mdash; and whether
        the fix is in the filters, the strategy, or the market conditions &mdash; is diagnostic
        intelligence.
      </p>

      <h3>No feedback loops</h3>
      <p>
        None of these systems are allowed to use their own previous output as evidence for their
        next decision. The AI can't retry a failed operation on its own. It can't treat something
        it said earlier as a fact. It can't build on top of its own guesses. Every decision starts
        from verified data, not from the AI's prior conclusions. This prevents the kind of
        compounding errors where a small early mistake snowballs into a catastrophic one.
      </p>

      <h2>What's running right now</h2>

      <p>
        Four systems currently implement these patterns in production:
        <strong>CodeReview AI</strong> reviews pull requests against your team's actual documentation.
        <strong>Finance Assistant</strong> analyzes stocks through a three-stage pipeline with dual
        compliance gates. <strong>TradeEngine</strong> is an autonomous crypto trading agent with
        five circuit breakers and fail-closed execution at every step. <strong>Morning Briefing</strong>
        delivers a personalized daily intelligence email. Each is described in detail on the
        <a href="tools.html">Tools</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
        The AUFG (Alexandrian Unified Field Geometry) research program runs under the same governance:
        every experiment is locked, reproducible, and falsification-first. New inventions are checked
        against a verified library of prior patents and papers to prevent overlap before any claims
        are drafted. This is how a patent portfolio grows without accidentally re-inventing something
        you've already filed.
