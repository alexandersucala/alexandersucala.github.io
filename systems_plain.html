      <h1>Systems</h1>
      <p class="subtag">
        I build systems that keep research and AI programs reliable while you improve fast — so you don’t
        accidentally trust a “success” or "correct answer" that was actually wrong.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about" aria-label="Overview">
      <h2>What these systems are for</h2>
       <p>
        In real research and real software, the worst failures are the quiet ones — the ones you think are
        correct. A program finishes, you get results or feedback, and only later you realize something was
        wrong: the inputs changed, a setting was different, or it just failed silently.
      </p>

      <p>
       These systems are designed to make that almost impossible. They catch problems early, keep a clear
       record of what happened, and make results repeatable no matter what AI you use, when you use it, or
       where you run it from.
     </p>

     <p>
      In short, I design AI systems that either work correctly or fail loudly — so the mistake is obvious
      and can be fixed instead of quietly happening again.
     </p>

      <h2>Core systems</h2>

      <h3>AUFG research system</h3>
      <p>
        AUFG runs like a lab program.
        Each experiment creates a it's own historical data,
        making it easy to reproduce and compare results across changes.
        The goal isn’t impressive charts — it’s trustworthy measurement.
      </p>

      <h3>Fail-closed execution</h3>
      <p>
        If something is wrong, the run is marked invalid and stops early.
        This prevents results that look finished but are actually based on bad assumptions.
      </p>

      <h3>Artifact-first records</h3>
      <p>
        Every attempt leaves behind a clear record.
        Even failed runs produce useful evidence,
        making debugging faster and decisions easier to defend later.
      </p>

      <h3>Deterministic randomness and enforced interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Randomness is controlled instead of left to chance.
        Inputs and interfaces are enforced so small, silent changes
        don’t sneak in unnoticed.
      </p>

      <h3>Novelty checking against prior work</h3>
      <p>
        New ideas are checked against a trusted library of prior papers and patents.
        This helps catch overlap early and speeds up iteration:
        check → decide → adjust.
      </p>

      <h3>Exploratory research infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Long-term exploration needs more than basic testing.
        These systems protect how tests are ran and clarity
        while still letting work move quickly.
